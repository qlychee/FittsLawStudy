Summary: We tested pointings tasts with two conditions: using a graphics tablet (Wacom bamboo) with a pen, and using the trackpad on a MacBook Pro. The software used for the point task was the Java app GoFitts, by Scott MacKenzie on Mac. There were 9 sequences in randomized order with varying indices of difficulty. We then compared the throughput for each condition.      
<br> 
<br>
Findings: The graphics tablet and pen performed better than the trackpad with higher throughput, as seen with the bar graph below.
