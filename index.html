   Fitts' Law Study: Graphics Tablet vs Trackpad    
    </b>

   <b>Summary</b>
<br>
   We tested pointing tasks with two conditions: using a graphics tablet (Wacom bamboo) with pen, and using the trackpad on a MacBook Pro.
   The software used for the point task was the Java app GoFitts, by Scott MacKenzie on Mac.
   We each participated in this study for a total of two subjects and tested each condition. 
   Conditions were alternated since this was a within-subjects study, so one person started with the trackpad and the other started with the graphics tablet before testing the other condition.
   There were 9 sequences of pointing tasks in randomized order with varying indices of difficulty for each trial. 4 trials were conducted, so a total of 36 pointing tasks were completed.
   We then compared the throughput grand mean for each condition.      
<br> 
<br>
   <b>Findings</b>
<br>
The graphics tablet with pen performed better than the trackpad and resulted in higher throughput grand mean, as seen with the bar graph below.
